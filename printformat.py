# print(f"My name is {name}  age {age} address {address}")             LATEST
# print("my name is {}  age {}  address {}".format(name,age,address))  OLDER
# print("My name is %s "%name)                                         OLDEST

#BASIC INPUT METHOD WITH STORED VARIABLES-
#x=10
# print(x)

# name ='ram'
# age =20 
# address ='kathmadu'
# print ("my name is ",name)
# print ("my age is ",age)
# print ("i live in ",address)

#TO CALCULATE SIMPLE INTEREST-
# principle = int(input("enter the principle:"))
# time =  int(input("enter the time:"))
# rate = int (input("enter the rate:"))
#  SI = principle*time*rate/100
# print(f"the simple interest of the given is: {SI}")

#TO CALCULATE TOTAL MARKS OF 5 SUBS-
# mat = int(input("marks of Maths: "))             BIT MORE ADVANCED INPUT METHOD
# eng = int(input("marks of English: "))
# nep = int(input("marks of Nepali: "))
# soc = int(input("marks of Social Studies: "))
# ecom = int(input("marks of Economics: "))
# Total = mat+eng+nep+soc+ecom
# print(f"the total marks of the 5 subjects is: {Total}")
